# sma_data_logger
An Arduino based data logger that interfaces with SMA inverters. This was developed for my Engineering Honours project at the Australian National University.

There are two Arduino programs included in this repository - the main sma_data_logger program that implements the data logger itself, and fcs_eeprom_setup which loads the lookup table required for calculating the checksum into the EEPROM.

I recommend that you have a read of my thesis before trying to run the code - it will give you a rundown of the hardware that I have used and an overview of the code. My thesis can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/azm2l0rcag02svn/christopher_tapper_Thesis_updated_20150207.pdf?dl=0
