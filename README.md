# sma_data_logger
An Arduino based data logger that interfaces with SMA inverters. This was developed for my Engineering Honours project at the Australian National University.

I recommend that you have a read of my thesis before trying to run the code - it will give you a rundown of the hardware that I have used and an overview of the code. My thesis can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/azm2l0rcag02svn/christopher_tapper_Thesis_updated_20150207.pdf?dl=0
